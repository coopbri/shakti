Shakti contains several components for designing layouts, including a flexbox-based grid system.

## Grid System
The grid system is loosely similar to <DocLink href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</DocLink>'s grid structure:

```tsx
<Grid>
    <Row>
        <Col>🌲</Col>
        <Col>🍄</Col>
    </Row>

    <Row>
        <Col>🍁</Col>
    </Row>
</Grid>
```

All of the grid components (`Grid`, `Row`, and `Col`) have flex enabled by default, and all `Flex` props apply.

### `Grid`
Serves as a container component for a layout. Rows (`Row`) are nested within. `Grid` is flex-enabled with column direction by default.

### `Row`
Represents a physical row in a layout. Columns (`Col`) are nested within. `Row` is flex-enabled with row direction by default.

### `Col`
Represents a physical column in a layout. Nested within a `Row`. `Col` is flex-enabled with column direction by default.


## Other
Aside from the grid system, there are some other props designed to be used more independently.

### `View`
Vanilla `div` with the ability to augment via <DocLink to="/base">Base</DocLink> props.

### `Flex`
Same as `View`, but with `display: flex` enabled by default and access to `Flex` props.
