import {shaktiProps} from "../constants"

Shakti comes with base augmentation props that can be applied to all components in the library. The props include basic functionality, such as margin, padding, and coloring. They are designed to facilitate rapid prototyping and development.

### Display
Control the displayed state of an element.

<PropTable propList={shaktiProps.display}/>


### Margin
Modify the margin of an element. Pixels are used as the unit if a number is specified. If a string is specified, it is assumed that a unit (e.g. <code>em</code>) is passed in.

<PropTable propList={shaktiProps.margin}/>

### Padding
Modify the padding of an element. Pixels are used as the unit if a number is specified. If a string is specified, it is assumed that a unit (e.g. <code>em</code>) is passed in.

<PropTable propList={shaktiProps.padding}/>

### Color
Modify the base colors of an element.

<PropTable propList={shaktiProps.color}/>
