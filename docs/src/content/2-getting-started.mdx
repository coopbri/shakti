Shakti comes with several utilities, components, and props to help you quickly create production-ready React applications. It was built with freedom and composition in mind, and allows easy access to the underlying technology. Shakti components and props compose a lightweight abstraction layer on top of vanilla HTML, vanilla CSS, and <ExternalLink href="https://styled-components.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">styled components</ExternalLink>.  Not only can pieces of the library be imported as needed, but they can also be composed upon with ease (see <DocLink to="/recipes">Recipes</DocLink>).

This documentation is broken up into logical parts, and is designed to be accessibly readable in any order.

- <DocLink to="/base">Base</DocLink> contains an outline of the base props that are accessible in all Shakti components.
- <DocLink to="/layout">Layout</DocLink> contains details about the various layout components, including the built-in grid system.
- <DocLink to="/text">Text</DocLink> contains information about the <code>Text</code> component, which allows you to mix the aforementioned base props as well as some text-specific props into your text compositions.
- <DocLink to="/text">Button</DocLink> contains information about the <code>Button</code> component, which allows you to mix both base props and text props.


Beyond components and props, Shakti also offers utility methods and hooks which remove the need to write raw media queries, among other benefits.

- <DocLink to="/media">Media</DocLink> contains tools for working with various media sizes and responsive design.

For comprehensive example usage of library features, take a look at the <DocLink to="/recipes">Recipes</DocLink> section.
