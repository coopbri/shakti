## Overriding Breakpoints
The default Shakti breakpoints can be overwritten by creating a higher-order export using object composition with the <DocLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spread operator</DocLink>. As an example, let's say you wanted to

    1. overwrite the value for the *small* breakpoint (<code>sm</code>), and
    2. create a new breakpoint for extra-extra-large screen sizes called <code>xxl</code>:

```ts
// üìÅ shadowedBreakpoints.ts

import { breakpoints } from 'shakti';

const shadowedBreakpoints = {...breakpoints, sm: 700, xxl: 1600}

export default shadowedBreakpoints;
```

Now, they can be imported in another file.

```ts
import shadowedBreakpoints from "/path/to/shadowedBreakpoints";

// use your new breakpoints
const sm = shadowedBreakpoints.sm;
const xxl = shadowedBreakpoints.xxl;
```
